    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>We need one centralized website, that includes community clinics and Spanish language. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="b">
      <p>I checked the county site, there were no appointments available there, but saw that there could be availability at pharmacies.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="c"><p>No one recorded I visited last Friday so I had to wait an extra hour while they completely re-registered us...</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>They need more people to answer phones for older people who cannot book online.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>I scheduled it using my smart phone during the wait time for the first dose.</p></div>


    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="c"><p>Patients there don't have internet access or have limited access, can't spend all day in the car (Dodger stadium). </p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>She was notified via text and email about the appointment for her second dose.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="b">
      <p>I had to go to each individual phamacy store site until I found an opening.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="a">
      <p>I advise seniors to go to the LA County Dept. of public health website for more info.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>She found out from the news that she was eligible for the vaccine but was confused because in her county she was not yet eligble.</p></div>

    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>Navigating all of the links is too hard for older users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="c"><p>There were no options for her to change location, date or time.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="b">
      <p>She got an email from the county [about her elegability]. She had to request to be notified.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>Make sure that there are enough doses for people to get their second dose while it's still within the maximum efficacy window.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>These websites are not cell phone friendly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="b">
      <p>You have to go to each store's website speratly to check availibility. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>Booking an appointment for her non-tech savvy mom was a nightmare.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="c"><p>They automatically scheduled the same day and time as soon as she was eligible, 4 weeks out.  No option to change. </p></div>


    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>It took her and her brother to continuously searcing the sites for a week and half to locate an appointment. </p></div>

    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="b">
      <p>They need more people to answer phones for older people who cannot book online.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="a">
      <p>Patients with limited internet access do have smart phones with access. Or their kids do. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="c"><p>they kept mixing up people in lines. At first we were mixed in with people on the waitlist and we were supposed to be priority.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>Her daughter says that an email provided a link to available appointments, but the window was not specific to the date she got her first appointment.</p></div>



    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>She was emphatic that her mom would never have been able to make an appointment alone.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="c"><p>it was a mess - there weren'y any clear signs about where to go and where to line up </p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="b">
      <p>While some people are waiting for a person to pick up, other people are taking the appointments online.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>The people who most need the vaccine (non-english speaking, not tech savvy, older) are the least able to use the websites for registration</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>She could have booked her 2nd dose too soon had she not marked on her own calendar when to get the second dose.  </p></div>



    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>When I arrived to my second appointment it was a Friday,they ran out 20 people before me so I had to reschedule</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>separate access to vaccines by community clinics, pharmacies and community orgs who can register on behalf of people who can't use the websit</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>It was incredibly time-consuming.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="b">
      <p>You have to put in all of your information (name, address, insurance) before they show you if there are appointments.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="c"><p>Also they opened 1 hour late, they were supposed to open at 8 and they opened at 9am.</p></div>

    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>More centralized website for appointment options</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="c"><p>When they are vaccinated at the clinic, it is more or less random, based on when the clinic has vaccine supply and who is there.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="b">
      <p>She could not book or go to the site by herself, it was too confusing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>She received an email that she should book a second appointment, which she forwarded to her daughter.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>Her mom is not even on a smartphone, so being asked to clink on alot of links to access new pages would be very hard.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item" data-cat="c"><p>They do keep a list of high priority patients that they contact, but they have no way of planning because vaccine delivery is irregular.</p></div>

    <div class="portfolio-item one" data-cat="a">
      <p>Make sure that you do not need to visit two sites in order to get an appointment. Navigating all of the links is too hard for older users.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item three" data-cat="b">
      <p>Her daughter helped fill out all the info including insurance, but then there would be no available appointments. This was very frustrating.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item five" data-cat="e"><p>Make the process easier for elderly persons.</p></div>
    <div class="portfolio-item four" data-cat="d"><p>There should have been an option to notify someone else, like a caregiver or family member.</p></div>
