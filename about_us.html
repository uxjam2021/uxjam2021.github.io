      <button id="accordion-button-1" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">What is a hackathon/jam?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>A hackathon is any event of any duration where people come together to solve problems (and it does not have to involve technology). Participants typically form groups of about 2-5 individuals, take out their laptops (if the event is
          technology themed), and dive into problems.

          Similarly, a jam is a gathering of people of different backgrounds such as designers, business people, academics, students, and customers who are interested in service and customer experience at various locations around the globe (sources:
          hackathon.guide; Beirut Service Jam). Sometimes jam is used in the context of service, community, etc.

      <button id="accordion-button-2" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">What is the goal for this hackathon/community jam?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>The hackathon/jam taking place on March 26th through March 28th 2021 will be an online collaboration of folks from various backgrounds and levels of experience coming together to tackle COVID-19 vaccine registration challenges that users are
          currently facing. Winners will receive recognition and get feedback from industry experts/professionals.

      <button id="accordion-button-3" aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">Why join?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>This is an opportunity to come together with our various lenses and experiences to tackle the challenge of a global pandemic, share ideas, and find solutions with the potential to benefit millions of people’s lives. You will learn creative
          problem solving and get hands-on experience applying user experience (UX) design principles. You might even make new friends/connections :)

        </span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        <p>Participation in the hackathon is open to individuals aged 18 or older. You don’t have to be a designer or work in tech to join! We welcome diverse backgrounds/experiences and believe these contribute to valuable, unique insights.

          <br>You are welcome to bring friends! Part of the first day is getting to know each other. We also encourage people to sign up solo, and we'll be supporting team-forming. Once you register on Eventbrite, you can also join the Slack
          workspace for the event beforehand and post there to find potential teammates.</br>

        <p>As the work leans on the efforts of all team members throughout the weekend, unfortunately you cannot. There will be breaks throughout the event and time to work on projects offline if teams choose to do so. We understand if you may need
          to hop on/off a bit early or step out for a few minutes/hours to take care of other obligations, such as family and work.

          <br>We look forward to contributions from all team members! And in case you’re nervous, we’d like to share some great points by MLH:</br>
          “You might think your project isn’t impressive or it might not be finished so you don’t want to present it. You should present it anyway! Honestly, hackathons isn’t about being the best or being competitive. It’s all about having fun,
          making friends and learning how to become better at things you care about. Presenting your hack gives you a chance to be proud of what you’ve done, and you should be proud.”
