      <h1>Community Jam Term & Conditions</h1>
      <p>Entry conditions:</p>
    </header>
    <div id="content">
      <p>Participation in this Community Jam/hackathon is open to individuals age 18 or older. You do not have to be a designer or work in tech to join! We welcome diverse backgrounds/experiences and believe these contribute to valuable, unique insights.
      </p>
      <p>Part of the first day will be spent getting to know each other. You are welcome to bring friends to partner with, but many people will be joining solo, so we will be supporting team-forming efforts early on. Once you register on Eventbrite, you can also join the Slack workspace for the event beforehand and post there to find potential teammates.</p>
    </div>
    <header>
      <p>Submissions will be rated on the following criteria:</p>
    </header>
    <div id="content">
      <p>1. How effective is the solution in addressing the problem put forth by the Community Jam/Hackathon?
      </p>
      <p>2. How well does the solution address the team's proposed problem statement?
      </p>
      <p>3. How impactful is the solution idea?
      </p>
      <p>4. How feasible is the solution idea?
      </p>
      <p>5. How user-friendly is the solution?
      </p>
      <p>6. How clearly has the solution been presented/communicated by the team?
      </p>
      <p>Please score the team's work by answering these questions on a scale of 1-10, (1 = not at all, 10 = extremely well).</p>
    </div>
